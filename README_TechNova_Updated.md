# 📊 TechNova Sales Insights Dashboard

Power BI dashboard project for analyzing sales, revenue trends, and customer behavior at TechNova Systems. Built using SQL, Power Query, DAX, and AIMS Grid for business planning. Enables real-time insights and automated reporting from a MySQL-based transactional system.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard solution** developed for **TechNova Systems**, a computer hardware company with operations across multiple regional markets. The dashboard is designed to provide deep insights into **sales performance**, **revenue trends**, and **customer behavior**, helping stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions in a highly competitive industry.

The primary goal of this project was to address the challenge of manual reporting and lack of real-time visibility into sales operations. By integrating **Power BI** with a **MySQL transactional database**, the project transforms raw data into a visually rich and interactive dashboard that simplifies business analysis and strategic planning.

Built using **SQL for data extraction**, **Power Query for ETL**, and **DAX for calculated measures**, the dashboard includes:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for total revenue, transactions, and customers  
- Regional sales analysis (e.g., revenue from Mumbai vs other markets)  
- Product category breakdown to identify top-performing product types  
- Monthly and yearly revenue trends with dynamic filtering capabilities  

The project simulates real-world enterprise analytics practices, including stakeholder planning, data discovery, and dashboard delivery. It serves as an excellent example of how modern data tools can be used to unlock business value and streamline decision-making processes.
